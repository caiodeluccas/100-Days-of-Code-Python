# Day 3 Project - Treasure Island

## Instructions

Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

 I think the fun part is writing your *own* story ![😊](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/14.0/1f60a/32.png)

That said if you'd like to continue with my example, feel free to use the text snippets below...

### Text Snippets from my example

- 'You're at a crossroad. Where do you want to go? Type "left" or "right"'
- 'You've come to a lake. There is an island in the middle of the lake. Type "wait" to wait for a boat. Type "swim" to swim across.'
- "You arrive at the island unharmed. There is a house with 3 doors. One red, one yellow and one blue. Which color do you choose?"
- "It's a room full of fire. Game Over."
- "You found the treasure! You Win!"
- "You enter a room of beasts. Game Over."
- "You chose a door that doesn't exist. Game Over."
- "You get attacked by an angry trout. Game Over."
- "You fell into a hole. Game Over."

# Escaping Characters

If you want to use multiple sets of quotes inside a single string, you might have to "escape" some of them using the backslash `\`. You can see this in my first sentence: 'You're at a crossroad...'. [More on escaping characters here.](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_escape_characters.asp)

# Extensions

Have a think about how you might write your program to make a player's answers less case-sensitive. In other words, your code should work regardless of whether your user answers "left" or "Left".

[You can also add your own ASCII art](https://ascii.co.uk/art). Just remember to add three single quotes `'''` at the start and at the end of your artwork to turn it into a multi-line string.
