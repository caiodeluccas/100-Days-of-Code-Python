## Day 2 Project - Tip Calculator

## Instructions



1. Ask the user the valor of the bill.
2. Request the number of people that would split the bill
3. Request the amount they wish to pay as tip, in percentage
4. Calculate and print the valor that each person will pay, with only 2 decimals.



Ex:

If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6

Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Thus everyone's share of the total bill is $30.00 plus a $3.60 tip.
